Installing the Sqoop Connectors
-------------------------------

To install the Sqoop connectors, open the distribution archive
in a convenient location such as +/usr/lib+. This will create a
directory such as +/usr/lib/sqoop-nz-connector-{revnumber}+
that contains the jar file of the compiled version of
all connectors. Note the path to this jar file. For example,
+/usr/lib/sqoop-nz-connectors-{revnumber}/sqoop-nz-connectors-{revnumber}.jar+.

Next, create a text file called +connectors+ in a directory named
+managers.d+ within the configuration directory of Sqoop.  Create
the directory +managers.d+ if it does not exist.

NOTE: Depending on how Sqoop is installed, its configuration
directory may be in +/etc/sqoop/conf+, +/usr/lib/sqoop/conf+ or
elsewhere if Sqoop was installed using the tar-ball distribution.

The +connectors+ file must have the connector class name followed by the
complete path to the directory where the connector jar is located.
For example:

----
com.cloudera.sqoop.manager.NetezzaManagerFactory=/usr/lib/nz-sqoop-connectors-X.X/nz-sqoop-connectors-X.X.jar
----

The +NetezzaManagerFactory+ acts as a single point of delegation
for invoking the applicable connector bundled with this distribution.
However, in order to use a specific connector, there may be additional
steps necessary to configure it. Refer to the connector-specific
section below in order to complete those steps. You need to complete
these steps only for the specific connectors that you intend
to use.

Uninstalling the Sqoop Connectors
---------------------------------

To remove the Sqoop connectors, delete the +connectors+
file from +managers.d+ directory located under Sqoop configuration
directory, and remove the files from the connectors distribution.
If you did any additional steps for the installation of specific
connectors, refer to the connector-specific section below to
continue to any connector-specific uninstall steps as necessary.
