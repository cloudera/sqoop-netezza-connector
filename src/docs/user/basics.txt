Installation
------------

In order to install the Sqoop connectors, untar the distribution
in a convenient location such as +/usr/lib+. This should result
in the creation of directory +/usr/lib/sqoop-connectors-{revnumber}.+
This directory contains the jar file which has compiled version of
all the connectors. Note the to this jar file. For example, the 
path could be: +/usr/lib/sqoop-connectors-{revnumber}/sqoop-connectors-{revnumber}.jar+.

Now create a file called +connectors+ in the directory +$SQOOP_CONF/managers.d+.
This file should have the connector class name followed by the 
complete path to the directory where the connector jar is located.
For example:

----
com.cloudera.sqoop.manager.EnterpriseManagerFactory=/usr/lib/sqoop-connectors-X.X/sqoop-connectors-X.X.jar
----

NOTE: Depending upon how Sqoop is installed, the +$SQOOP_CONF+ 
directory may be in +/etc/sqoop/conf+, +/usr/lib/sqoop/conf+ or 
elsewhere if Sqoop was installed using the tar-ball distribution.

It is possible that the directory +managers.d+ does not yet exist.
In that case, you must create this directory in order to install the
connectors. 

The +EnterpriseManagerFactory+ acts as a single point of delegation 
for invoking the applicable connector bundled with this distribution.
However, in order to use a specific connector, there may be additional
steps necessary to configure it. Please refer to the connector specific
section below in order to complete those steps. You need to complete
these steps only for the specific connectors that you would intend
to use.

Uninstall
----------

In order to remove the Sqoop connectors, simply delete the +connectors+
file from +$SQOOP_CONF/managers.d+ directory and remove the files
from the location the connectors distribution was unpacked. If you 
did any additional steps for the installation of specific connectors,
please refer to the connector specific section below to continue to any
connector specific uninstall steps as necessary.
