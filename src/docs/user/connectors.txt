Available Connectors
--------------------

This release of Sqoop Connectors provides the connector for Netezza Database
System via Netezza JDBC Version 5.0 drivers. This connector is formally known
as the Cloudera connector for Netezza.

Cloudera Connector for Netezza
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Cloudera connector for Netezza provided with this release of Sqoop Connectors
is designed to use Netezza's high-throughput, data transfer system.

Installation and Removal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To ensure that Cloudera connector for Netezza can be used,
copy the Netezza JDBC driver in the +lib+ directory of Sqoop installation.
This driver may be obtained from the Netezza Client distribution for your
operating system. Without this driver, the connector will not function
correctly.

If you are uninstalling the Sqoop connector, you should also remove the JDBC
driver for Netezza that you copied to the +lib+ directory of Sqoop installation
because Sqoop will no longer need it.

Using Cloudera Connector for Netezza
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After Sqoop connectors have been installed and the necessary JDBC driver for
Netezza has been copied to the +lib+ directory of Sqoop installation, you can use
this connector by invoking the Sqoop tools with the appropriate connection
string. The Cloudera connector for Netezza will be used by Sqoop only if the
connection string being used is of the form
+jdbc:netezza://<nz-host>/<nz-instance>+ where +<nz-host>+
is the host name of the machine where Netezza server runs and +<nz-instance>+
is the Netezza database instance name. Also, in order to effectively use the
Netezza connector, you must specify the +\--direct+ option along with
a number of mappers greater than one.


For example, the following command invokes the Sqoop import tool with eight
mappers and uses the Cloudera connector for Netezza.

----
$ sqoop import --connect jdbc:netezza://localhost/MYDB --username arvind \
--password xxxxx --direct --table MY_TABLE --num-mappers 8 --escaped-by '\\' \
--fields-terminated-by ',' --lines-terminated-by '\n'
----

This command invokes the Sqoop export tool with eight mappers and uses
the Cloudera connector for Netezza.

----
$ sqoop export --connect jdbc:netezza://localhost/MYDB --username arvind \
--password xxxxx --direct --export-dir /user/arvind/MY_TABLE --table MY_TABLE_TARGET \
--num-mappers 8 --input-escaped-by '\\' --input-fields-terminated-by ','
----

IMPORTANT: The Cloudera Connector for Netezza does not support the specification of
+\--input-enclosed-by+ or +\--input-lines-terminated-by+ options. Both of these
settings when specified during an export operation will be ignored. Also, the only
supported escape character is the back-slash (+\+) character.
