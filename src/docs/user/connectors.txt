This release of Sqoop Connectors provides support for the following enterprise
systems:

`--------------------------------`------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Netezza Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Netezza connector provided with this release of Sqoop Connectors is designed
to work with Netezza's fast-path data transfer system. For optimal performance
we recommend that the user specify the +\--direct+ argument during import and
export invocations of Sqoop.

Installation and Removal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to ensure that Netezza connector can be used, you must place the
Netezza JDBC driver in the +$SQOOP_HOME/lib+ directory. Without this driver
the Netezza connector will not function correctly. 

If you are uninstalling the Sqoop connectors, you should also remove the JDBC
driver for Netezza that you placed in the +$SQOOP_HOME/lib+ directory as it 
will no longer be needed by Sqoop.

Usage
^^^^^

Once Sqoop Connectors have been installed and the necessary JDBC driver for 
Netezza has been placed in the +$SQOOP_HOME/lib+ directory, you can exercise
this connector directly by invoking Sqoop tools with appropriate connection
string. The Netezza connector will kick in only if the connection string being
used is of the form +jdbc:netezza://<nz-host>/<nz-instance>+ where +<nz-host>+
is the host name of the machine where Netezza server runs and +<nz-instance>+
is the Netezza database instance name. Also, in order to effectively use the
Netezza connector, you must specify the +\--direct+ option along with explicitly
set number of mappers as greater than one.


For example, an import invocation would be something like follows:

----
$ sqoop import --connect jdbc:netezza://localhost/MYDB --username arvind \
--password xxxxx --direct --table MY_TABLE --num-mappers 8 --escaped-by '\\' \
--fields-terminated-by ',' --lines-terminated-by '\n'
----

Similarly, an export invocation will be as follows:

----
$ sqoop export --connect jdbc:netezza://localhost/MYDB --username arvind \
--password xxxxx --direct --export-dir /user/arvind/MY_TABLE --table MY_TABLE_TARGET \
--num-mappers 8 --input-escaped-by '\\' --input-fields-terminated-by ',' \
--input-lines-terminated-by '\n'
----

IMPORTANT: At this time, the Netezza connector for Sqoop requires that the format options 
be explicitly set to: field delimiter as comma (,), record delimiter as new-line ('\n')
and escape character as back-slash (\). Failing to set these explicitly could result in
unexpected behavior of the system.
