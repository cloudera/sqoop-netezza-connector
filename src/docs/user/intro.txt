Introduction
------------

Sqoop connectors are standard Sqoop extensions that allow Sqoop to
operate with specialized enterprise systems such as Netezza or Teradata. After
installation, these connectors allow various Sqoop tools such as
+sqoop-import+ and +sqoop-export+ to operate directly with these
enterprise systems.

This document describes how to install and configure these
connectors within a Sqoop installation and provides reference
information for the operation of such connectors where necessary.
This document is intended for:

- System and application programmers
- System administrators
- Database administrators
- Data analysts
- Data engineers
