Testing for Netezza is performed against a Netezza simulator VM.
The simulator can be downloaded from http://developer.netezza.com/
and initialized by following the instructions there. This should be
run on an external machine with 4+ cores and 8+ GB of RAM to spare.

On the development machine where tests will be run, /etc/hosts should
contain a line specifying the NZHOST's IP address as hostname 'nzhost'.

e.g.:
aaron@paperweight:~$ cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.127 paperweight localhost
127.0.1.127 paperweight
192.168.42.238 nzhost



When the netezza system is running, create a user named SQOOPTEST
and a database named SQOOPTESTDB like so:

$ nzsql -u admin -p password -d system -h nzhost

# Create test database.
=> CREATE DATABASE SQOOPTESTDB;

# Create a Sqoop user.
=> CREATE USER sqooptest WITH PASSWORD 'sqooptest';
=> \q


#  Log back in to the sqooptestdb database, as the admin.
$ nzsql -u admin -p password -d sqooptestdb -h nzhost

# Grant all privs on the sqooptestdb to sqooptest.
=> GRANT ALL ON sqooptestdb TO sqooptest;

# Grant ability to create/delete tables to sqooptest.
=> GRANT TABLE TO SQOOPTEST;
=> \q
