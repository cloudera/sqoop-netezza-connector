To configure sqoop 1.1.0 to use the sqoop-connectors library:

1) Register the new ConnectionManager with Sqoop in its configuration.

Add a file in $SQOOP_HOME/conf/managers.d (for RPM/Deb installs,
/etc/sqoop/conf/managers.d) with any filename (e.g., 'netezza') which contains
the following:

com.cloudera.sqoop.manager.EnterpriseManagerFactory=/path/to/sqoop-connectors/build/sqoop-connectors-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar


If you are installing this at a client site, place the
sqoop-connectors-1.0.0.jar file in /usr/lib/sqoop/lib, and then you do not
need to specify a path. The file can simply contain the line:

com.cloudera.sqoop.manager.EnterpriseManagerFactory


2) Place any additional JDBC drivers (e.g., nzjdbc3.jar for Netezza) in
$SQOOP_HOME/lib (/usr/lib/sqoop/lib/).

2a) If you can't/don't want to do this, you can always specify them on the
command line with "HADOOP_CLASSPATH=/path/to/nzjdbc3.jar sqoop import ..."

3) The normal Sqoop interface should now work with your EDW. Try:

  $ sqoop import --connect jdbc:netezza://nzhost/nzdb --username ...
