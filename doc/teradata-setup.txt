Testing for Teradata is performed against a Teradata Virtual Machine (VM).
The VM can be downloaded from http://downloads.teradata.com/download/database/teradata-express/vmware
and initialized by following the instructions there.

When the Teradata system is running: ssh to the system (the default username/password
are root/root). Start the bteq utility ($bteq) from the command prompt. Logon to
the database using the command:

$.logon localTD/dbc
password: dbc.

Create a user named sqooptest and a database named sqooptest like so:

$CREATE user sqooptest AS password=sqooptest perm=524288000 spool=524288000;

A Teradata test instance is already running and configured on 172.29.13.157
