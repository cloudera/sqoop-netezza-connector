BUILDING:

You can build this project using ant. This project depends on Sqoop, and on
unreleased features (1.1.0+, available on the master branch). This project
uses sqoop through maven/ivy.

You should check out sqoop.git in the usual location and build it with:
$ ant mvn-install

This will build Sqoop and push that to your local ~/.m2 repository.

Then you can build sqoop-connectors:

$ ant jar -Dresolvers=internal

The -Dresolvers=internal specifies that it should look in the local filesystem
for Sqoop.


CONFIGURING:

See doc/netezza-setup.txt for instructions on how to configure a Netezza test
environment.

See doc/configuring.txt for general instructions on how to tell Sqoop to use
the third-party adapter package


TESTING:

There are some unit tests provided with this project.
You can run them with:

$ ant test -Dresolvers=internal

These will connect to a Netezza simulator at '//nzhost'; you should add this
to your /etc/hosts file as per doc/netezza-setup.txt.
